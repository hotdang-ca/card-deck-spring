# Deck of Cards
## A ~~Spark~~ Spring Java Project

## What is this?

I was asked to do a code test for a scenario, whose text will remain anonymous (so that others do not google-search my repository).

The project is written in Java; see below for class descriptions. The Main class itself is a ~~SparkJava~~ Spring Boot class which can be run once built.

## Getting Started

This project is written with Maven in mind, and the Main solution is a Spring Boot web server.

You'll need at least:

* Maven
* Java 1.8+

Nice to have:

* IntelliJ IDEA

Drop into a shell in the main project directory, and issue the maven  command:

```shell
mvn package
```

Then, run the built artifact:

```shell
java -jar target/spring-carddeck-1.0.0.jar
```

## Endpoints

Provided you get the solution running the following endpoints provide functionality:

`GET /deck/` - shows you the current deck

`GET /deck/new` - discards the current deck, and creates a new, ordered deck (fresh out of the package!)

`GET /deck/shuffle` - shuffles the deck, returns the current state of the deck

`GET /deck/describe` - I love this one... rather than returning a deck, this describes the current deck in either long or short format.
To get the short format, include url param `type=short`.

`GET /deck/deal` - Deals a card. Output will be the card you were dealt. It will be removed from the internal instance (because it's now in the hands of a player, presumably).
You can also specify a url param of `number=n` where `n` is the number of cards you want dealt.

## Testing

TODO

## TODO

* Include the Joker cards
* Keep track of multiple decks (which can be namespaced in the url path)
* Deal all the cards until the deck is depleted of cards
* Tests
